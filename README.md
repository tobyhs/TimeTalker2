# Time Talker

Time Talker is an Android app that speaks the time.

You will need to enable this by opening the app and toggling the Enabled
switch. When enabled and your phone's ringer is on, shake your phone within 10
seconds of the screen turning on, and your phone will speak the time. It is
designed this way so that shake detection isn't always on (which would waste
battery resources).

After turning on your phone, the screen-on detection will be enabled because I
was too lazy to persist the option. This may change in the future if I have too
much spare time.

This is a rewrite of https://github.com/tobyhs/TimeTalker.
